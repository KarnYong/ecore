This connector allows to interact with OCCI servers:
* import OCCI entities from an OCCI server
* create/read/update/delete OCCI entities hosted by an OCCI server
* execute OCCI actions on OCCI entities

Current supported OCCI servers are [erocci](http://erocci.ow2.org) and [rOCCI](https://github.com/EGI-FCTF/rOCCI).

This connector is based on [jOCCI](https://github.com/EGI-FCTF/jOCCI-api), a Java-based OCCI client library.
