For OCCI Metamodel:
- warning scheme is of type String when its is of type URI in the paper for IEEE CLOUD 2015
- Add more OCL constraints to check
  - unicity of importation ?
  - an action of a kind not already defined in parent ?
  - an action of a mixin not already defined in depends ?
  - TODO: when calling aString.substring(x,y) check that y is not superior to aString.size()
  - TODO: relation between attributes of a mixin and attributes of its applies kinds.
  - ...
- Must Attribute refer a EDataType (currently what it is in OCCI.ecore or own it's own EDataType?
- Should Extension and Category contain OCL constraints to check consistency?
- LinkKind extends Kind and reference both target and source Kind?

For OCCI Core:

For OCCI Infrastructure Extension:
- TODO: set type of all attributes.
- Add more annotations to constraint attribute datatypes.
