For OCCI Metamodel:
- warning scheme is of type String when its is of type URI in the paper for IEEE CLOUD 2015
- Add more OCL constraints to check
  - unicity of importation ?
  - an action of a kind not already defined in parent ?
  - an action of a mixin not already defined in depends ?
  - TODO: when calling aString.substring(x,y) check that y is not superior to aString.size()
  - TODO: relation between attributes of a mixin and attributes of its applies kinds.
  - ...
  - OCL inv for tests/MixinAtributes.xmi
- Must Attribute refer a EDataType (currently what it is in OCCI.ecore or own it's own EDataType?
- Should Extension and Category contain OCL constraints to check consistency?
- LinkKind extends Kind and reference both target and source Kind?
- TODO: test Kind.entities and Mixin.entities as derived
- Do we consider that data types MUST BE ALWAYS declared into an extension?
  then we could set invariants like
  - kinds.attributes.type included into types or import.types
  - kinds.actions.attributes.type included into types or import.types
  - mixins.attributes.type included into types or import.types
  - mixins.actions.attributes.type included into types or import.types

- Add Configuration endpoint attribute ?
- Add Configuration.description human readable
- Add Configuration.mixins relation
- Add Attribute.multiplicity: Boolean = false, false -> attribute with one value, true -> multi-valued attribute
